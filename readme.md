Integer
=======
Various integer routines.

Prime
-----
Ways of computing prime numbers, [OEIS A000040.](http://oeis.org/A000040)
-  Sieve, a sieve of Eratosthenese.
-  PQueue, a priority queue.
-  SPRP, a strong probable-prime test.
-  Segment, a parallel segmented sieve.

Swing
-----
Computation of swinging factorials, [OEIS A056040.](http://oeis.org/A056040)

Factorial
---------
Ways of computing the factorial, [OEIS A000142.](http://oeis.org/A000142)
-  Split Recursive, very efficient and without computation of prime numbers.
-  Prime Swing, most efficient for large numbers.  Involves computing swinging factorials, which in turn involves computing prime numbers.
-  Double Factorial [OEIS A001147.](http://oeis.org/A001147)

Binomial
--------
Efficient computation of the [binomial coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient).

Xmath
-----
Some simple support functions.
